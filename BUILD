    If you want to fix this issue you can add to your project's dependencies:

      "dependencies": {
        "winston": "^0.7.1",
      }

    Or do a npm install --save winston@0.7.1, since it is the last version Gearmanode had compatibility with winston. That should solve your problem as it solved mine.
